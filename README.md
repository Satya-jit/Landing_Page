# Landing_Page
So,The technology i have used is HTML //For Static web page
                                  Css //For Styling the html page
                                Jquery//For Animation and for Reach user interface.
                            JavaScript//For trigger the jquery Code to Animate.
 For fonts i used "googleapi" fonts.and one image for background.
 The code for animate both for CSS and JQuery is precoded to give a more responsive and mobile friendly web app.
 Thank you
